# DataProjects

This is a repository hosting my Data Science projects.

### concrete predictor

This is a project developed to build a Regression model to predict numeric concrete strength using all numeric data.

**Skills**

* Setting up database using MongoDB
* Using Pandas to build DataFrame from DB and perform data manipulation and breif data exploration
* Used Plotly to build a fully interactive histogram to see distribution of any variable with a drop down menu
* Used SciKit-Learn to build Machine Learning pipeline and Model, including preprocessing
* Use of Markdown within a Jupyter Notebook Environment

### ds jobs

This is a project developed to compare Data related job salaries in different sectors. This was performed to understand which company sectors pay better and which pay worse.

**Skills**

* Setting up a database using SQLite within a Python wrapper library SQLite3
* Using Pandas to create DataFrame from queried SQLite data
* Using Pandas to do some Data Manipulation and Exploration
* Using NumPy to get statistics needed for new columns
* Using lambda functions to streamline these new columns
* Creating my own functions to avoid repetitive code
* Using Scipy to run statistical tests
* Using Markdown to explain statistical results

### financial market

This is a project developed to use financial data to help understand which sectors are the best investments. This dataset was good for Data Visualization and Exploration but lacked some information to do any model building.

**Skills**

* Setting up a database using SQLite within a Python wrapper library SQLite3
* Using Pandas to create DataFrame from queried SQLite data
* Using Pandas to do some Data Manipulation and Exploration
* Using user defined functions to help build interactive plots with Plotly (located in helper functions folder)
* Used Markdown to expain findings

### helper functions

A side project that will continue to grow as I write more functions. This is intended to be a repository for code I will continue to use for the rest of my career. Contained in simple .py files rather than a notebook.

### recommendation engine

This was a project developed as part of my work with a startup, Snapbrillia. The intent of this project was to build a recommendation engine with data found online to build a proof of concept for the actual model implemented within our app.

**Skills**

* Setting up a database using SQLite within a Python wrapper library SQLite3
* Using Pandas to create DataFrame from queried SQLite data
* Using Pandas to do some Data Manipulation and Exploration
* Using SciKit-Learn to build pipeline
* Used CountVectorization and cosine_similarity to make recommendations
* Displayed rusults within a Pandas Series
