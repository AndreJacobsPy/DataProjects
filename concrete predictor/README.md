# Concrete Strength Predictor

This is a project intended to showcase a basic forcasting model for predicting concrete strength based on measurable input materials. I used data from a DataCamp competition. This showcases data skills such as:

* Importing real life data from an external source
* Using MongoDB as a database to store data (not practical just for DB practice)
* Using a Jupyter Notebook with Markdown to help readers understand code
* Basic data cleansing using Pandas
* Data manipulation using Pandas
* Data Visualization using Plotly (a JS plotting library within Python)
* Machine Learning model using Sk-Learn library in Python
